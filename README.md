Iâ€™m a **Data Science and Analytics** student with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Systems, currently working as a full-stack web developer. Iâ€™m passionate about machine learning and deep learning, and gained hands-on experience in computer vision during an internship at **CERIST** in Algiers. I also enjoy mathematics and everything low-level, and Iâ€™m focused on continuous learning and building practical, impactful solutions.
